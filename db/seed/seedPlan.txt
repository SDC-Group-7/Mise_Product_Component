generate products
  x 1 csv file
  - insert data from file into pg
generate stores
  - generate 1 csv file (no need to use the drain/write stream on this)
  - insert data from file into pg
generate availabilities
  - make "generateAndWriteData" generic so you can use it for both products and availabilities
  - figure out how to get the foreign keys to match up (for seed generation)
      - every product should generate NUMBER_OF_STORES_CARRYING_EACH_PRODUCT (10) entries in availabilities
  - figure out how to separate into 5 csv files
  - remove foreign key constraints
  - insert data into pg
  - add constraints back on


availabilities
  - 10 csvs
  - for product id 1
    - at stores 1 - 10
    - increment store until hit TOTAL_STORES and then reset to 1 and start over
